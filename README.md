# Essential Buttons Toolbar and Homepage.
Adds a toolbar with essential buttons to customise the Android Firefox browser: Homepage, Duplicate Tab, New Tab, Close Tab, and more.

## Installation instructions.
The add-on is available on AMO (Mozilla Add-ons):

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/essential-buttons-toolbar/">

</a>

## Why?
This add-on aims to fill basic missing functionality in Android Firefox. The main reason is to provide a normal home button.

The home button should not behave as the new tab button. This behavior is not intuitive and differs from the standard behavior found in most browsers, including the desktop version of Firefox, which follows the universal approach to the home button.

## Tips and tricks.
There is no way to set the Firefox homepage to the one opened by this add-on.
While some users use the Firefox home button as a new tab button, I suggest that you ignore that button and disable all the settings by going to **Menu** -> **Settings** -> **Homepage**, and under Opening screen, select **Last tab.**

It is also very useful to change the settings in **Delete browsing data on quit.** You can uncheck all the options except for **Downloads.** Enabling this option will display a **Quit** option at the bottom of the Firefox menu. Closing the browser in this way is ideal, as the next time you open the browser, it will load the pages you had opened.

## Known issues:
Some websites are not well optimized for mobile. Some will have a little zoom that will make the toolbar be displayed outside of the viewport or display only a part of it. You can find the toolbar by zooming out.

## Note:
This initially began as a userscript, which I later developed into an extension to access additional features.
You can still find the original user script here, but I'm unlikely to make further updates to it:
