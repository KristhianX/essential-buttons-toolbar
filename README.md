# A real home button.
*An extension that adds homepage, new tab, and close tab buttons to Android Firefox.*

**Note:**
This initially began as a user script, which I later developed into an extension to access additional features. You can still find the original user script here, but I'm unlikely to make further updates to it: https://github.com/KristhianX/a-real-home-button



## Why?
I want to clarify from the beginning that this add-on is not meant as negative criticism of Firefox's developers. I genuinely appreciate Firefox and its core values. The purpose of this add-on is to assist users like me who find it challenging to adapt to the behavior of the home button in Android Firefox. Many people choose Firefox for various reasons, such as its open-source nature, security features, and its commitment to keeping the web user-centric rather than controlled by large corporations.
Unfortunately, some users become discouraged by issues like this and switch back to other browsers. To illustrate the problem with the home button, consider this analogy: It's like downloading a text editor, and the 'Save' button automatically acts as 'Save As,' resulting in a clutter of unnecessary files. The home button should not behave as the new tab button. This behavior isn't intuitive and differs from the standard behavior found in most other browsers, including the desktop version of Firefox, which follows the universal approach to the home button.

## Ok, but what about the other buttons?
Though opening a new tab and closing tabs is not difficult, why not make them even more accessible?



## Features.
Buttons in the toolbar:

Home button: Opens the default homepage URL. Can be changed in options.

Hide button: Hides the toolbar. Refresh the page to display it again.

Move button: Moves the toolbar to the top of the page or to the bottom if it is at the top.

Close button: Closes the current tab. If the current tab is the only open tab, it opens the homepage URL instead.

New tab button: Opens the default new tab page URL. Can be changed in options.




## Other features.

The toolbar automatically hides when scrolling.

Toolbar height: The number of pixels. The default value is set to 46 for ease of use.

Exclude URLs: Specify which web addresses to exclude.
